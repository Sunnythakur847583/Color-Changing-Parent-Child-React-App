Parent-Child Color Change Example
This repository contains a simple React application that demonstrates how to change the color of a parent component based on input from a child component. The child component contains a color picker input, which allows the user to select a color. The selected color is then passed to the parent component to change the background color of a box in the parent component.

How It Works
Parent Component: The parent component (ParentComponent) contains a box (div element) whose background color changes based on the color selected in the child component. The parent component also includes the child component.
Child Component: The child component (ChildComponent) contains an input element of type color that allows the user to select a color. When the color changes, the child component uses a function passed from the parent component to update the parent component with the new color.
Communication: The child component communicates the selected color to the parent component using a function (onColorChange) passed as a prop from the parent to the child.
